## Metacontroller

Metacontroller is an add-on for Kubernetes
that makes it easy to write and deploy [custom controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers).

This is not an officially supported Google product.
Although this open-source project was started by [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/),
the add-on works the same in any Kubernetes cluster.

Please see the [documentation site](https://metacontroller.app) for details.
